//! Using names.txt, a 46K text file containing over five-thousand first names,
//! begin by sorting it into alphabetical order.
//! Then working out the alphabetical value for each name,
//! multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name score.
//! For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order,
//! COLIN, which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list.
//! So, COLIN would obtain a score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.
//! What is the total of all the name scores in the file?
