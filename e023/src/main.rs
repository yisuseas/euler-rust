//! A perfect number is a number for which the sum of its
//! proper divisors is exactly equal to the number.
//! For example, the sum of the proper divisors of 28 would be
//! 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28,
//! which means that 28 is a perfect number.
//! A number n is called deficient if the sum of its proper divisors
//! is less than n and it is called abundant if this sum exceeds n.
//! As 12 is the smallest abundant number, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16,
//! the smallest number that can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers is 24.
//! By mathematical analysis, it can be shown that all integers
//! greater than 28123 can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers.
//! However, this upper limit cannot be reduced any further by analysis
//! even though it is known that the greatest number that cannot be expressed as
//! the sum of two abundant numbers is less than this limit.
//! 
//! Find the sum of all the positive integers which
//! cannot be written as the sum of two abundant numbers.
